# Firm Bank Pasbook Analysis – Tableau Dynamic Dashboard

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a firm's financial transaction data extracted from multiple CSV files using Python (Pandas). The goal was to automate the reporting process, visualize financial health, and assist in better budget planning.

After performing data cleaning and transformation (ETL), including handling unstructured data and splitting rows, a dynamic Tableau dashboard was created. The dashboard uses lollipop charts, donut charts, bar graphs, and highlighted tables to deliver a clear and interactive financial overview.
